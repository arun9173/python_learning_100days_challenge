########################################### INSTRUCTIONS #####################################

Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

Under 18.5 they are "underweight".
Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a "normal weight".
Over 25 but below 30 they are "slightly overweight".
Over 30 but below 35 they are "obese".
Above 35 they are "clinically obese".

Note :
 BMI formula:-
 BMI = weight / height^2
 
 BMI = Body mass index

######################################## EXAMPLES ############################################

Example Input
weight = 85
height = 1.75

Example Output
85 ÷ (1.75 x 1.75) = 27.755102040816325
Your BMI is 28, you are slightly overweight.

############################################# PRACTICE CODE ####################################

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
height = float(input("enter your height in m: "))
weight = float(input("enter your weight in kg: "))
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this line 👇

result= weight / (height ** 2)
bmi = round(result)
if bmi < 18.5 :
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are underweight.")
elif bmi < 25 :
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you have a normal weight.")
elif bmi < 30 :
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are slightly overweight.")
elif bmi < 35 :
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are obese.")
else:
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are clinicly obese.")
